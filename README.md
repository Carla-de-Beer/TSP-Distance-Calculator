# Travelling Salesman Distance Calculator

Genetic algorithm to find an optimised solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem.
The program dynamically reads in city data from a file and calculates the shortest distance it can find, linking all cities.
The actual physical distance on the route, calculated as the Haversine distance, is also shown.
Specifiable parameters: crossover rate, mutation rate, population size, max. no. iterations, elitism generation gap.
